# COVID-19 Game

A Pac-Man inspired game where you play as a coronavirus trying to eliminate the population. Built with TypeScript and Phaser 3.

## 🎮 How to Play

### **Q: How do I play this game?**
**A:** Just like Pac-Man! Use the arrow keys to move around the maze.

### **Q: What are arrow keys?**
**A:** Get a real computer, you hipster! Use the directional keys on your keyboard.

### **Q: I can't use the arrow keys. I only have thumbs!**
**A:** That's evolutionary pressure from not using a real computer.

### **Q: What do I do if my boss comes in and sees me playing this instead of working?**
**A:** Quick! Press the ESC key!

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### **Q: What are the different characters in the game?**
**A:** 
- **Coronavirus (You)**: The main character you control
- **Innocent Victims**: The population you need to eliminate
- **Gregs (Tiny Lauries)**: Ghost-like enemies that can kill you
- **Aunt Society**: Golden spoon-like objects that can kill the coronavirus
- **Europe**: EU flag boosters that give you temporary power

### **Q: Why is the booster pill like a EU flag?**
**A:** Why do you think?

### **Q: But a star is missing!**
**A:** Brexit.

### **Q: When I eat the booster pill I can eat the gregs!**
**A:** You wouldn't think this yourself if I hadn't FAQed it here, would you?

### **Q: And that golden spoon-like thing that kills the poor coronavirus? What is it?**
**A:** There is no spoon. This is The Holy Cochleareum of Aunt Society.

### **Q: Aunt Society? Who's Aunt Society?**
**A:** If you were Greek, you'd understand.

## 🐱 Lives System

### **Q: Why do I have eight lives? They're too many.**
**A:** A cat has seven. Coronavirus apparently has more.

### **Q: Why do I only have eight lives? They're too few.**
**A:** I'd consider myself lucky if I had eight.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### **Q: What's that TypeScript thing you wrote this on?**
**A:** Something Microsoft invented to make web bozos feel like real software engineers.

### **Q: Did that succeed?**
**A:** So much, that they started thinking they can write real software too.

### **Q: What do you mean, they can't?**
**A:** Look around you.

## 🎭 Character Rights

### **Q: But, this is Hugh Laurie!**
**A:** No, it's Tiny Laurie. It's only 50x50 pixels.

### **Q: Do you have his permission to use his face in such a game?**
**A:** No, but if he sends me an e-mail asking me to, I'm willing to replace his character with Tsiodras.

### **Q: Who is Tsiodras?**
**A:** Never mind.

## 🐛 Known Issues

### **Q: The Tiny Lauries move like shit. They often totally block some innocent victims and I cannot eat them.**
**A:** That's not a bug. I documented it here, hence it's a feature.

## 💻 Code Quality

### **Q: Your code sucks.**
**A:** That's what your mom said.

## 🌍 Cultural Sensitivity

### **Q: You're being insensitive to Europeans!**
**A:** And they've been insensitive to almost anybody too.

### **Q: You're being insensitive to coronavirus patients!**
**A:** But they won't be complaining about this for too much longer, if you know what I mean.

### **Q: You're being insensitive to viruses!**
**A:** I live in Asia. I'm probably gonna pay for this sooner or later. We call it Karma.

## 🎨 Graphics

### **Q: The maze looks awful. Can't you draw a straight line using a fucking computer?**
**A:** Tell that to my mother. She's still wondering why I didn't become an architect.

### **Q: But the coronavirus is cute. You did draw that yourself?**
**A:** Yes, based on an idea from my amazing friend, XXX YYY.

## 📄 License

### **Q: Is that kota public license OSI compliant?**
**A:** Ask OSI.

## 🧼 Moral of the Story

### **Q: What's the moral of this game?**
